# Introduction

## What is data science?

One widely accepted concept is the three pillars of data science:
mathematics/statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge.

In her 2014 Presidential Address, Prof. Bin Yu, then President of the
Institute of Mathematical Statistics, gave an interesting definition:
```{math}
\mbox{Data Science} =
\mbox{S}\mbox{D}\mbox{C}^3,
```
where S is Statistics, D is domain/science knowledge, and
the three C's are computing, collaboration/teamwork, and communication
to outsiders.


## Set up Computing Environment

All setups are operating system dependent.

As soon as possible, stay away from Windows. Otherwise, good luck (you
need it).

### Command line interface

### Python

- Install Python package manager __miniconda__ or __pip__.
- Install Python
- Install an IDE (Jupyter Notebook or VS Code)

### A book project with Jupyter-book

- Markdown for text
- Jupyter notebook for code demo
- Jupytext

### Git and GitHub
